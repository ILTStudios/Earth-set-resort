          Budget Price
          <div>The Budget Price of our Hotel ranges from $5k to $10k depending on the amount of extra luggage and the access card bought. <br>
            This Budget Price is the lowest out of all our competitors and provides a variety of luxuries that aren't found in this price range. <br>
            From Accesability to the Full-Access Card to 3 Course Meals. The Budget Price really is a bang for the Buck for all Residents. <br>
            The Drawbacks of the Budget Price however is that your stay can only be awaited till 3 days, any longer and you will have to upgrade. <br>
            The Budget Price also gives the Residents a King sized bed upon the top-deck.
